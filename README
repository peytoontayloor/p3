COMP/ELEC/MECH 450/550
Project 3

What are we doing?
------------------

 1. Use random tree planner (RTP) in "RTP.cpp" and "RTP.h".
 2. Run path planning problems with point and box robots in two environments in "Project3Exercise2.cpp"
 3. Visualization solution path in environment in "visualizeScript.py":

How do I run the code?
----------------------

Using the provided Makefile, our project can be compiled and run in COMP 450 Docker image.
Once compiled, there is the following binary file:
 1. Project3Exercise2, which prompts you for which robot and which environment
 you would like to plan for

Further to visualize, utilize:
 2. visualizeScript.py, which prompts you for what environment to the solution path was found in
    to display visualization.
